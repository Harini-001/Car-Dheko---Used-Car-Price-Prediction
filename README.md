# Car-Dheko---Used-Car-Price-Prediction

## Problem Statement
In the automotive industry, pricing used cars accurately is essential for both customers and sales representatives. The aim of this project is to enhance customer experience and streamline the pricing process by leveraging machine learning techniques. The objective is to develop an accurate and user-friendly tool that predicts used car prices based on various features, which will be integrated into a Streamlit-based web application for real-time user interaction.

## Solution Steps
1. Data Processing
Data Importing and Concatenation: Import and structure data from multiple city-specific datasets. Add a new column for city names and concatenate all datasets into a single dataset.
Handling Missing Values: Identify and fill or remove missing values using appropriate imputation techniques for both numerical and categorical data.
Standardizing Data Formats: Ensure all data types are correct, converting strings to integers as necessary (e.g., removing units).
Encoding Categorical Variables: Convert categorical features to numerical values using techniques like one-hot encoding and label encoding.
Normalizing Numerical Features: Scale numerical features to a standard range (0 to 1) using Min-Max Scaling or Standard Scaling.
Removing Outliers: Identify and manage outliers using methods like IQR or Z-score analysis.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Descriptive Statistics: Calculate summary statistics to understand data distributions.
Data Visualization: Use scatter plots, histograms, box plots, and heatmaps to visualize patterns and correlations.
Feature Selection: Identify key features impacting car prices through correlation analysis and feature importance.
3. Model Development
Train-Test Split: Split the dataset into training and testing sets (commonly 80-20).
Model Selection: Choose appropriate algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest) for price prediction.
Model Training: Train selected models on the training dataset, utilizing cross-validation.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize model parameters with techniques like Grid Search.
4. Model Evaluation
Performance Metrics: Evaluate model performance using MAE, MSE, and R-squared.
Model Comparison: Compare models based on evaluation metrics to select the best-performing one.
5. Optimization
Feature Engineering: Create or modify features based on domain knowledge and EDA insights.
Regularization: Apply techniques like Lasso and Ridge to prevent overfitting.
6. Deployment
Streamlit Application: Develop and deploy the model using Streamlit for an interactive web application.
User Interface Design: Ensure a user-friendly design with clear instructions.
## Conclusion
This project successfully developed a machine learning model to predict used car prices, offering a comprehensive analysis of the dataset and integrating it into an interactive Streamlit application. The tool enhances customer experience by providing instant price estimates based on user input. Documentation and visualizations support the findings and methodologies, ensuring transparency and understanding of the processes involved.
